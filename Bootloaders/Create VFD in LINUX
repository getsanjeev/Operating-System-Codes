To get a virtual floppy drive formatted as FAT12 you can simply do something like:


dd if=/dev/zero of=floppy.img bs=512 count=2880
losetup /dev/loop0 floppy.img
mkdosfs /dev/loop0
mount -t vfat /dev/loop0 /media/floppy

Name of image is floppy.img and is created in the terminal directory.


Unmounting it can be done using:


umount /dev/loop0
losetup -d /dev/loop0

dd if=bootloader_1.bin bs=512 of=/dev/floppy.img
