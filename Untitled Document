1. Shell Basic functions:

Initialize: In this step, a typical shell would read and execute its configuration files. These change aspects of the shell’s behavior.
Interpret: Next, the shell reads commands from stdin (which could be interactive, or a file) and executes them.
Terminate: After its commands are executed, the shell executes any shutdown commands, frees up any memory, and terminates.

2. The Parser
The Parser is the software component that reads the command line such as “ls ­al” and puts it 
into a data structure called ​Command Table that will store the commands that will be executed.

3. The Executor
The executor will take the command table generated by the parser and for every 
SimpleCommand in the array it will create a new process. It will also if necessary create pipes to communicate the output of one process to the input of the next one.
